# Rock-Paper-Scissors-OOP
This is another remake of rock, paper, scissors but created using OOP. Made this the morning of 11/4/21 around 530-630.
It is a basic game that I didn't put a whole lot of thought into making it the absolute best, just got it to the point where it will explain the rules and then let you play. I also let my mom played this game then switched it to Python Project 10 which is rigged against the user to lose. It was a very funny reaction from her.
